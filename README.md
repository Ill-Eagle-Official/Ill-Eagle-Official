- Hello there! Thanks for visiting my GitHub page! My name is Alex Jackson, a full-stack web developer transitioning from the world of falconry. 

- My greatest passion in life is improving the world around me, whether it be through my work or through my attitude in daily life.
- Transitioning from the world of environmentalism will be hard at first, I know it, but through hard work and dedication I know I will be able to contribute to making the world a better place!

- After leaving the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Program, I am taking some time to learn Python and PHP, as well as developing educational and business applications for friends and family!

- I would love to contribute to open source software once I am a bit more proficient in my chosen languages; helping others is what I'm all about!

- Please feel free to reach out to me via these links!
